ALX Higher Level Programming - Python Basics
This repository contains solutions to various tasks related to higher-level programming in Python. Each task is organized into separate directories, and the scripts are designed to demonstrate different Python concepts.

Task Descriptions
Task 0: Run Python file
Write a Shell script that runs a Python script. The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE.

Task 1: Run inline
Write a Shell script that runs Python code. The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE.

Task 2: Hello, print
Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle," followed by a new line. Use the function print.

Task 3: Print integer
Complete the source code to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by "Battery street," and a new line. The code must be 3 lines long and use f-strings.

Task 4: Print float
Complete the source code to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits. Use f-strings.

Task 5: Print string
Complete the source code to print the value of the variable str three times, followed by its first 9 characters. The program should be maximum 5 lines long, with no loops or conditional statements.

Task 6: Play with strings
Complete the source code to print "Welcome to Holberton School!" without using loops or conditional statements. The program should be exactly 5 lines long.

Task 7: Copy - Cut - Paste
Complete the source code to print the first 3 letters, last 2 letters, and middle word of the variable word. The program should be exactly 8 lines long.

Task 8: Create a new sentence
Complete the source code to print "object-oriented programming with Python," followed by a new line. The program should be exactly 5 lines long, with no new variables or string literals.

Task 9: Easter Egg
Write a Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, followed by a new line. The script should be a maximum of 98 characters long.

Task 10: Linked list cycle
Write a function in C, int check_cycle(listint_t *list), that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle. Return 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle. Only the functions write, printf, putchar, puts, malloc, and free are allowed.

Task 11: Hello, write
Write a Python script that prints "and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19," followed by a new line. The script should print to stderr, use the write function from the sys module, and exit with the status code 1.

Task 12: Compile Python script
Write a script that compiles a Python script file. The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable $PYFILE. The output filename has to be $PYFILEc (e.g., export PYFILE=my_main.py => output filename: my_main.pyc).

Task 13: Magic Calculation
Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as the provided Python bytecode. The bytecode performs a mathematical operation and returns the result.

Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine:
